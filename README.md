# To-Do-List-In-React
I used react hook useState to save state when it's written into the input and JS spread operator with an array. When the add button is pressed, the current data in the input is
added to an array.
No database is connected, the items of the to-do list are added to an array and disappear after refreshing. 
The style was created by Angela Yu from the App Brewery bootcamp.
